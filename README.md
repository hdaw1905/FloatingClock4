# FloatingClock
This code is a Python **GUI clock** with an **alarm** feature that allows users to **set an alarm** and **choose a song** to play when the alarm **goes off**. It uses the ``tkinter`` library for creating the graphical interface and the ``pygame`` library for playing audio.

The clock displays the **current time** and **updates every second**. ``To set an alarm``, users can **choose** the ``hour``, ``minute``, and ``second`` from **drop-down menus** and **click** the ``"Set Alarm"`` button. Users can also **change** the clock's **background color** by clicking the ``"Change Color"`` button and **selecting** a color from the color picker.

To use this code properly, users should **ensure** that they have installed ``Python 3.x`` and the necessary **libraries**, including ``tkinter`` , ``pygame`` and `` datetime``. Users can run the code in their preferred Python environment or text editor. They should also **ensure** that they have audio files in a **compatible format** **(.ogg is most perefrable)** to use as an alarm sound.
